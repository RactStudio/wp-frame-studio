Project Plan
The WP Frame Studio Ecosystem




1. Project Mission & Core Philosophy
Mission: To create an enterprise-grade development framework for WordPress that provides a modern, expressive, and robust toolset inspired by Laravel, optimized for performance and modularity within the WordPress ecosystem.
Core Principles:
1. WordPress-Native: The framework is not a replacement for WordPress. It hooks into and enhances the existing WordPress request lifecycle, functions, and APIs.
2. Developer Experience (DX): Prioritize a clean, modern, and intuitive API that reduces boilerplate. Includes strong CLI scaffolding for quick starts.
3. Modularity & Opt-In: Features (Services) must be highly independent, loaded via Service Providers, and only initialized if configured for use (Opt-in Architecture).
4. Security First: All data access and manipulation must enforce WordPress best practices: input sanitization, capability checks, and nonce verification built into the core layer.
5. Contract-Driven: Core services are defined by interfaces to enable easy replacement and testing.
2. Architectural Commitments & Risk Mitigation
This section directly addresses the complexity and performance risks identified in the critique:
Risk/Area
	Mitigation Strategy
	Implementation Detail
	Complexity / Overload
	Extreme Modularity & Opt-in: Major features (Queue, ORM, Events) are self-contained modules loaded only when their Service Providers are registered and their config files exist.
	If config/queue.php is missing, the QueueServiceProvider is skipped entirely, reducing container bindings.
	Performance / Load
	Lazy Loading & Benchmarking: All Service Providers are designed for deferred loading, only initializing services when they are first called via the Facade or app() helper.
	Initial deployment will include benchmarking to establish a low, acceptable memory footprint, especially on shared hosting environments.
	WP Compatibility
	Strict Contract/Interface Adherence: Define clear Service Contracts for core features (e.g., OptionRepositoryInterface, QueueInterface). This makes the framework testable against WP core changes.
	All custom features use WordPress hooks exclusively, ensuring non-collision and proper lifecycle integration.
	Maintenance/Testing
	Comprehensive Test Suite: Implement Unit and Integration tests for every core feature, especially around security and data layers.
	Use versioning (Semantic Versioning) and a clear deprecation policy documented in the README.
	Developer Onboarding
	Scaffolding & Documentation: Add make: commands to the CLI for rapid file generation and provide extensive examples for the most common tasks (CPT, Blocks, REST).
	Theme and Plugin skeletons will include a fully functional sample application.

8. The Boot Process (How It All Connects)
This sequence incorporates the new features, focusing on the early initialization of the Session Manager and the immediate availability of the Request object.
1. WP Request: A user visits the site. WordPress boots.
2. WP Loads Plugin/Theme: WordPress loads my-awesome-plugin.php (or my-awesome-theme/functions.php).
3. Framework Entry Point: require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';.
4. Framework Bootstrap: $app = require_once __DIR__ . '/bootstrap/app.php';.
5. bootstrap/app.php Executes:
   * Creates $app = new RactStudio\FrameStudio\Foundation\Application(__DIR__);
   * $app->singleton(...) Binds all core services (like CacheManager, Connection, Router) to the container.
   * $app->boot() is called.
6. Application->boot() Executes:
   * Runs all Bootstrap classes (loads .env, loads user config/ files).
   * Session Initialization: The StartSession.php bootstrapper runs, initializing the SessionManager and loading any existing session/flash data from the database/transients, making the Session facade available immediately.
   * Loops through config('app.providers') and registers each User Service Provider (e.g., PluginServiceProvider).
   * Calls the register() method on all providers.
   * Calls the boot() method on all providers.
7. User Code Runs:
   * Inside PluginServiceProvider::boot(), the developer's code runs, e.g.:
      * Hook::action('admin_bar_menu', [AdminBar::class, 'addItems']);
      * Gutenberg Block Registration: Block::register(CtaBlock::class);
      * Asset Manifest/Enqueue: Enqueue::register(AssetManifest::class); The Enqueue Manager now uses the new AssetManifest helper to resolve production-ready, versioned asset URLs.
8. Framework Connects to WP:
   * The HookManager takes all registered classes and calls the native add_action() and add_filter().
   * The BlockManager hooks into init and calls register_block_type() for all defined classes, pointing the render callback to the framework's View Manager (Twig).
   * The EnqueueManager hooks into admin_enqueue_scripts and wp_enqueue_scripts and uses the Asset Manifest to ensure correct asset loading.
9. WP Lifecycle Continues: WordPress continues its request cycle. If a request is handled by a controller, the framework automatically uses the new Form Request validation before executing the controller logic. If the request results in a redirect, the Session Manager handles saving the Flash Data (e.g., success message) for the next request.
